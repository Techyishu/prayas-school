# 3D Fonts

This folder is for 3D text fonts (JSON format for three.js Text3D).

## How to Add Fonts

1. Go to [Facetype.js](https://gero3.github.io/facetype.js/)
2. Upload a .ttf or .otf font file (e.g., Inter Bold)
3. Download the generated JSON file
4. Rename it to `inter_bold.json` and place it here

## Current Status

Currently using fallback 3D shapes instead of Text3D for better compatibility.
The stats counter uses metallic gold styled HTML text with 3D-like effects.

## Recommended Fonts

- Inter Bold - Modern, clean
- Outfit Bold - Geometric, futuristic
- Space Grotesk Bold - Techy feel
